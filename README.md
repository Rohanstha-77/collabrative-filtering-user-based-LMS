# LMS - Learning Management System

This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) built with a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React/Next.js, Node.js).

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js/Express.js server with MongoDB as the database.
- `client/`: Contains the Next.js frontend application.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- JWT for authentication
- Cloudinary for file uploads

### Frontend

- Next.js
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS (based on `tailwind.config.js` in `client/`)

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd LMS
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory, install dependencies, and set up environment variables.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add the following environment variables:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `client` directory and install dependencies.

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server

From the `backend/` directory:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### 2. Start the Frontend Development Server

From the `client/` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

This Learning Management System (LMS) project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a robust and interactive e-learning platform using the MERN stack. By leveraging Node.js and Express.js for a scalable backend, MongoDB for flexible data storage, and Next.js for a dynamic and responsive frontend, the system provides essential functionalities such as user authentication, comprehensive course management, and a personalized recommendation engine.

The architecture chosen ensures a modern, maintainable, and extensible application, capable of serving as a foundational platform for diverse educational needs. This project not only showcases proficiency in full-stack development but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including advanced analytics, real-time collaboration features, and expanded content delivery mechanisms, further solidifying its potential as a comprehensive learning solution.
